I've applied MVC as pattern for design the API and TDD for develop,
so there is a short explanation of my decisions and thinks about the code.


‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Here we have two different classes with same purpose

Router: I decided to save endpoints and param names in a router class, I think is easier if some day
        we want to change one of them.

Conf: For beans injections.

üïπ Controller

Controller was the past legacy package, there we have endpoints and just call to each service.
If everything is ok, they will response with an OK code.

‚öñÔ∏è Service

They have the business logic, they ask to repository about users, passwords and lists and they check
inputs and throw exceptions when a resource wont exist (not found) or when users will do something
incorrect (bad request) also they will save if everything is okay.

‚õîÔ∏è Exceptions

I dont want to throw existing exceptions so I've decided to have a couple of custom exceptions, they
extend runtime exception so I can throw them whenever.
BadRequestException for wrong inputs
NotFoundExceptions for not existing resources

ü§≤ Handler

They listen for custom exceptions and they will response with the http code and a explanation of the error.

üì∏ Model

I've decided to split passwords from users, Im not sure if this is the correct way but I think for friends
relationships we dont need passwords and it would be a security problem, so:

User and Password will throw an exception if input is different than the explanations of the problem.
Also, I've decided add a hash (md5) for passwords, a quick solution for not handle in clear sensitive data.

üíæ Repository

I decided to implement three different interfaces in a memory class.

UsersRepository 
    For the users and passwords, it will tell you if a user exists and will return its password.
    
FriendRepository & RequestRepository
    For the friends requests and friend lists, they will return and save the lists.
    I decided keep the relations duplicated, I mean, friend A in B list and friend B in A list. Other valid option would
    be have a relationship object composed of two users and keep in a single set this objects but I think this way
    will increase the complexion when someone wants to list friends‚Ä¶ (You have to iterate all set looking for object relation
    which contains the user).

MemoryRepository implements this three interfaces and keep objects in memory.
    - About linkedHashSet: 
        I decided to use concurrent hash maps with user as key and sets for the lists.
        I'd prefer to use just sets for the friend list but one of the tests that legacy team wrote
        told me that friend list has order.
